# ATP-Project
Project for ATP course at Ben-Gurion University 
*  Generating and solving mazes using different algorithms
*  Has 3D maze generation and solving extension
*  Uses Prim's Algorithm to generate maze
*  Uses BFS, DFS, BestFirstSearch for solving the mazes (can be implemented more)
*  Uses client-server side, compression for mazes and solution to mazes to send them from client to server and vice versa
